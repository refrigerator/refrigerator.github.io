Over the past few years, a lot of the life advice I've read has included keeping a record of one's goals. Sounds easy enough:

* Not fail my degree - do at least 4 hours of actual productive Maths every day
* Learn more about economics - read Piketty's *Capital in the 21st Century*
* Make gains - do a pull-up and push-up workout every day, go to the gym 2-3 times a week
* Sort out summer plans - find a cool internship abroad/travel opportunity
* Become less ignorant - read the news every day, read at least one longform current affairs piece every day
* Build products - work on at least one of my current projects every day

(these are in no particular order)

I feel like I should have some sort of religious goal on here, because I do want to learn more about Islam and become a better Muslim, but I haven't decided specifically how I'll do this yet, so I'll hopefully update this post in the next few days.
